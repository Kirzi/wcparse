# wcparse

Based off Porybox's [pkparse](https://github.com/porybox/pkparse): a wc6/wc7 parser. Also supports wc6full, wc7full, and decrypted Sun/Moon BOSS files. Works for item wondercards as well.

If you don't have the wc6/wc7 for the wondercard you want to view, you can usually find it [here at Project Pokemon's Event Gallery](https://github.com/projectpokemon/EventsGallery).
