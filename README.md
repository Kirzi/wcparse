# wcparse

Based off Porybox's [pkparse](https://github.com/porybox/pkparse): a wondercard file parser/viewer. 

Currently supports the following file types:

- wc6/wc7
- wc6full/wc7full
- Decrypted Sun/Moon BOSS
- pgf

If you don't have the file for the wondercard you want to view, you should be able to find it [here at Project Pokemon's Event Gallery](https://github.com/projectpokemon/EventsGallery).
