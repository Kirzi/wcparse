# wcparse

Parses and displays information from wondercard files from the Pokémon games.

![Screenshot](/img/screenshot.png?raw=true "Screenshot")

Currently supports the following file types:

- wc6/wc7
- wc6full/wc7full
- Decrypted Gen 7 BOSS
- pgf
- pcd/pgt (the non-encrypted parts)

If you don't have the file for the wondercard you want to view, you should be able to find it [here at Project Pokémon's Event Gallery](https://github.com/projectpokemon/EventsGallery).
