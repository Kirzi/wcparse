# wcparse

Based off Porybox's [pkparse](https://github.com/porybox/pkparse): a wc7 parser. 

It will usually work for wc6s as well, but some data may differ.

If you don't have the wc7 for the wondercard you want to view, you can download it [here at Project Pokemon's Event Gallery](https://github.com/projectpokemon/EventsGallery).
